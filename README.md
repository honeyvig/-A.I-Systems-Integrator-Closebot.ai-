# -A.I-Systems-Integrator-Closebot.ai
Hereâ€™s a Python code template to assist in building and automating AI sales agents using Closebot.ai along with GoHighLevel (GHL), Zapier, and APIs. The goal is to create a sales agent system that integrates with platforms like WhatsApp, handles user conversations, and automates sales processes for Caribbean businesses.
Overview of Steps

    Integrate Closebot.ai with GoHighLevel using APIs to manage leads, tasks, and customer data.
    Set up WhatsApp integration to send messages and get responses from customers.
    Create conversion-focused flows for sales agents in Closebot.ai.
    Optimize and test the system for sub-30-second response times and high conversation completion.

Assumptions

    You have access to Closebot.ai, GoHighLevel (GHL), and Zapier.
    The WhatsApp integration uses an API like Twilio.
    We'll focus on using Flask to manage API requests and integrate these tools.

Python Code Template

Explanation:

    WhatsApp Integration:
        Using Twilio API, we send messages to users via WhatsApp and respond based on the incoming messages.
        The send_whatsapp_message function sends messages to users, and the whatsapp_webhook function handles incoming messages.

    Lead Creation in GoHighLevel (GHL):
        The create_lead_in_ghl function integrates with GoHighLevel's API to create leads for users who express interest (e.g., by sending "book").

    Closebot.ai Interaction:
        The interact_with_closebot function sends messages to Closebot.ai for automated sales conversations.
        Closebot.ai processes the user inputs and generates relevant outputs based on the configured AI models.

    Zapier Automation:
        The trigger_zapier_event function triggers an automation event in Zapier (e.g., sending an email, updating CRM, etc.) based on certain actions or events in the flow.

    Testing System Performance:
        The test_system_performance function simulates an interaction with the system, measuring the response time and checking the conversion success (if the chatbot successfully handles the booking or query).

    72-Hour Delivery & Optimization:
        The implementation aims for rapid deployment within 72 hours, achieving response times under 30 seconds and high conversion completion (e.g., an 8/10 conversion success rate).

Features:

    AI Sales Agent: Build an AI sales agent that interacts with customers, understands their queries, and drives conversions.
    Multichannel Sales: Integrate WhatsApp, SMS, and other messaging platforms for reaching customers.
    Automation: Automate lead creation, follow-ups, and user interactions using Zapier.
    System Performance: Includes testing and optimizing the system for fast responses and conversion success.

Conclusion:

This solution integrates Closebot.ai, GoHighLevel, Twilio, and Zapier to automate AI-powered sales agents for Caribbean businesses. It helps reduce manual efforts, increases sales conversions, and enhances customer engagement, while also ensuring quick implementation and high performance.
